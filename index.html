                            The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is a space telescope designed primarily to conduct infrared astronomy. As the <em>largest optical telescope in space,</em> its high infrared resolution and sensitivity allow it to view objects too early, distant, or faint for the Hubble Space Telescope. This is expected to enable a broad range of investigations across the fields of astronomy and cosmology, such as observation of the first stars and the formation of the first galaxies, and detailed atmospheric characterization of potentially habitable exoplanets.

                <h2>SMACS 0723</h2>
                <p>
                    President Joe Biden unveiled this image of galaxy cluster <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMACS_J0723.3–7327">SMACS 0723</a>, known as Webb's First Deep Field, during a White House event Monday, July 11. NASA's James Webb Space Telescope has delivered the <em>deepest and sharpest infrared image of the distant universe so far.</em> Webb's First Deep Field is galaxy cluster SMACS 0723, and it is teeming with thousands of galaxies – including the faintest objects ever observed in the infrared. This image shows the galaxy cluster SMACS 0723 as it appeared 4.6 billion years ago, with many more galaxies in front of and behind the cluster. Much more about this cluster will be revealed as researchers begin digging into Webb's data. This field was also imaged by Webb's Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI), which observes mid-infrared light.

                <h2>Southern Ring Nebula</h2>
                <p>
                    The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NGC_3132">Southern Ring Nebula</a>, an expanding cloud of gas that surrounds a dying star, is approximately 2,000 light years away. Here, Webb's powerful infrared eyes bring a second dying star into full view for the first time. From birth to death as a planetary nebula, Webb can explore the expelling shells of dust and gas of aging stars that may one day become a new star or planet.

                            The James Webb Space Telescope's Mid-Infrared Instrument's (MIRI) grating wheel is experiencing a problem affecting some observations. The wheel, which allows selection between light wavelengths, is used in only one of MIRI's four observation modes.

                        <p>
                            The James Webb Space Telescope's discoveries continue to span the universe. The deep-space observatory observed an exoplanet with evidence of silicate-rich clouds; the brown dwarf is nearly 20 times the size of Jupiter. The brown dwarf is called VHS 1256 b and orbits two small red dwarf stars, 72 light-years from Earth Webb's sensitive instruments also revealed unprecedented detail in a gas cloud called Doradus 30, initially nicknamed Tarantula for its spider-like appearance. The Tarantula Nebula is located 161,000 light-years away in the Large Magellanic Cloud and is the brightest star-forming region in our neighborhood aside from our own Milky Way.
